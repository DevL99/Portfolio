# Portfolio

This is my first portfolio website and showcases what I've learned so far in the UTSA Bootcamp.

## Technologies Used

HTML and CSS


## Description

I did my best to create a responsive website that showcases what I've learned so far and will showcase future projects as I complete them later on. I used a lot of basic html and css and some advanced css to give this portfolio a more minimalistic and clean look while still showing what I've learned.

## HTML
I used pretty basic HTMl to create different sectiions such as the nav bar and hero section and created plenty of classes so I could style the page efficiently.

## CSS
I started by creating a lot of variables I knew were gonna be the same throughout the page such as certain text colors and background colors so that it would make it much easier to go back and change things if I wanted to. I also used media querys to make the page responsive depending on what device it's on.
